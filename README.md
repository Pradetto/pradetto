## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My names Michael Pradetto, I am a software engineer with 1+ years experience! I specialize in web development and enjoy having the capability to bring the frontend and backend of apps to life. I don't tie myself to any specific languages as I like to remain malleable and flexible to tailor my tech stack to what is most relevant for the project I am working on. If I had to choose favorites I love Python, Javascript and PostgresðŸ˜„ Open to help out on any projects and or you have any questions about being a self-taught engineer please feel free to reach out.
