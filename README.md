## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My names Michael Pradetto, I am a software engineer with 1+ years experience! I specialize in web development and like bring the frontend and backend of apps to life. I don't tie myself to any specific languages as I like to remain malleable and flexible to tailor my tech stack to what is most relevant for the project I am working on. If I had to choose favorites I love Python, Javascript and Postgres.ðŸ˜„ Open to help out on any projects and if you have any questions about being a self-taught engineer feel free to reach out.
